# 🚀 TaskBloomer: Where Priorities Blossom. 🚀 

Are you drowning in a sea of tasks, struggling to stay afloat trying to decide which tasks to prioritise? Say goodbye to chaos and hello to clarity with TaskBloomer, the task management app designed reward you for making three concise to-dos which shape your day.

## 🎯 Step 1: Streamline three main goals

Create three tasks, one big, one medium, one small. Each goal must be no more than 25 characters, so aim for something concise and intentional.

Prioritize your tasks with a user-friendly interface that ensures you spend less time managing and more time accomplishing. Say goodbye to scattered to-do lists and hello to efficient, well-organized workflow in three simple steps.

## 🌟 Step 2: Rank your tasks in order of priority

Each task is ranked from biggets to smallest, represeted by the amount of points each task earns you.

Task A, your biggest task, earns you three points when you tick it off. 
Task B earns you 2 points.
Task C, 1 point.

TaskBloomer understands the toll of decision fatigue on productivity. It's interesting to notice how decision making can become easier when you have points associated with them. That's what we are exploring here. 
Guide your decision-making process effortlessly with TaskBloomer to leave you with more mental bandwidth for the tasks that truly matter.

## 🏆 Step 3: Reward yourself with each completed task

By focussing on what matters most, each time you check off a goal, your points go towards earning you an NFT. With real-time progress tracking and a gallery at the end to look through all the lovely pieces you've collected from all your hard work, you'll always be in the driver's seat, steering towards success without feeling overwhelmed.

### Extra goodies:
1 - Track your progress with helpful stats and beautiful sets of NFTs from artists all over the world.
2 - Set the difficulty rating: choose if the amounts of points you need for each NFT are easier (less points needed per NFT), medium (a few more needed for each) or hard (for those who like a challenge).
3 - New lightmode feature for your tasks area.

✨ Simplify Your Life: Unclutter your mind and workspace for enhanced productivity.
✨ Stay Focused: Say goodbye to decision fatigue and hello to laser-sharp focus.
✨ Achieve More: Leverage your hard work by earning each time you complete a task, tracking progress to completing your gallery along the way.

🌺 TaskBloomer: Where Priorities Blossom 🌺


Dear Ambitious Achievers,

Whether you a professional seeking a better system to order their daily tasks, a freelancer juggling multiple projects feeling unrewarded by continuious to-dos, or perhaps an art enthusiast looking for their next online art collection, TaskBloomer is crafted with YOU in mind.

TaskBloomer is unique, not only because you earn points for every task you check off (which in itself is satisfying!), but your points automatically earn you assets each time you check off a task. You'll quickly find yourself noshing through those tasks for breakfast! 

The added benefit of including NFTs as part of your earning portfolio each time you hit a point threshold not only gives you the chance to look back at your NFTs and celebrate the work you have done to earn them, but also introduces you to new artists from across the globe!

## UX

TaskBloomer's design has been inspired by productivity sites such as Notion, featuring a deluxe yet visually simple aethetic to avoid overstimulation, with the main interactive areas clear and consise.

TaskBloomer is made up intentionally of two main pages (landing page with instructions, and the main task area) to make navigation feel clean and simple to use. All bonus features such as the stats area and gallery are included with user needs in mind. 
Principally the main ideas are prioritised:
- How to play 
- Setting consise task descriptions 
- Earning NFTs 
- Checking your stats

*Your feedback is crucial, so please share your thoughts to help us refine and enhance our user-centric approach. Let's make every click count! * 🚀 


### Colour Scheme

The default color scheme is a dark theme, consisting of the follwing colors:  

- `#0e100f` used for background.
- `#fffce1` used for primary text.
- `#93B569` used for primary highlights.
- `#BDBDBD` used for secondary highlights.

If light mode is enabled on the task area by the user, the following custom variables are used: 

- `#fffce1` used for background.
- `#3D3D3D` used for primary text.
- `#93B569` used for primary highlights.
- `#2c2c2c` used for secondary highlights.


I used coolors.co to generate my colour palettes.

[coolors.co](https://coolors.co/0e100f-fffce1-93b569-bdbdbd)

![screenshot](documentation/dark-mode.png)
![screenshot](documentation/light-mode.png)

I also ensured that for the text and background colors for both dark and light mode were verified accessible through coolors' [coolors.co] (https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5) color contrast checker for maximum accessibility.


### Typography

- [EB Garamond](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/EB+Garamond) was used for all text elements, chosen for its readability and established use across platforms.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the icons for the hero cards on the landing page.

## Wireframes

<!-- In this section, display your wireframe screenshots using a Markdown `table`.
Instructions on how to do Markdown `tables` start on line #213 on this site: https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html

Alternatively, dropdowns are a way to condense several wireframes into a collapsible menu to save space.
Dropdowns in Markdown are considered some of the only acceptable HTML components that are allowed for assessment purposes.

**IMPORTANT**! **IMPORTANT**! **IMPORTANT**!
The example below uses the `details` and `summary` code elements.
However, for these scripts to work, I've had to add spaces within the `< >` elements.

You MUST remove these spaces for it to work properly on your own README/TESTING files.
Remove the spaces within the `< >` brackets for the `details` and `summary` code elements,
for the Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop wireframes.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
