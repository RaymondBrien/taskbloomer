                    Welcome to TaskBloomer, the app designed to help with overwhelm, decision fatigue and workaholism.
                    <br>
                    <b>Step 1:</b> (fontawesome icon)
                    List three concise goals you want to achieve in your day. Make these achievable within your day. Remember, be specific and intentional: there’s a type limit for a reason.

                    Task A earns you the big money - 3 points! 
                    This should be your biggest task of the day, due first or most important.

                    Task B earns you 2 points.

                    Task C earns you 1 point.

                    Can’t think of three? Put an intention instead! 
                    How about: drink 6 glasses of water // meditate for 10 minutes // make time for a walk.

                    <br>
                    <b>Step 2:</b> (fontawesome icon)
                    Each time you complete a goal, click the ‘done’ icon and you earn points. Earn enough points and your plant will grow. 

                    Your goals self-destruct at 10pm each night. (insert fontawesome spy icon/emoji).

                    <br>
                    <b>Step 3:</b> (fontawesome icon)
                    Take a deep breath and focus on your tasks and watch your plant continue to grow!

                    <br>
                    Finished them all already? Go you! Celebrate, knowing you’ve done what you set out to do today. (boxed text to separate from rest of instructions)
                    <br>
                    In the words of Michael Scott, K.I.S.S - keep it simple, stupid. (set as footer of instructions section in block color)
                    Never-ending to-do lists and time crunches are exhausting. Focus on your three tasks, one at a time. You deserve to celebrate the little successes on the way to your big wins.
