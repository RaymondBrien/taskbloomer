# üöÄ TaskBloomer: Where Priorities Blossom. üöÄ 

Are you drowning in a sea of tasks, struggling to stay afloat trying to decide which tasks to prioritise? Say goodbye to chaos and hello to clarity with TaskBloomer, the task management app designed reward you for making three concise to-dos which shape your day.

## üéØ Step 1: Streamline three main goals

Create three tasks, one big, one medium, one small. Each goal must be no more than 25 characters, so aim for something concise and intentional.

Prioritize your tasks with a user-friendly interface that ensures you spend less time managing and more time accomplishing. Say goodbye to scattered to-do lists and hello to efficient, well-organized workflow in three simple steps.

## üåü Step 2: Rank your tasks in order of priority

Each task is ranked from biggets to smallest, represeted by the amount of points each task earns you.

Task A, your biggest task, earns you three points when you tick it off. 
Task B earns you 2 points.
Task C, 1 point.

TaskBloomer understands the toll of decision fatigue on productivity. It's interesting to notice how decision making can become easier when you have points associated with them. That's what we are exploring here. 
Guide your decision-making process effortlessly with TaskBloomer to leave you with more mental bandwidth for the tasks that truly matter.

## üèÜ Step 3: Reward yourself with each completed task

By focussing on what matters most, each time you check off a goal, your points go towards earning you an NFT. With real-time progress tracking and a gallery at the end to look through all the lovely pieces you've collected from all your hard work, you'll always be in the driver's seat, steering towards success without feeling overwhelmed.

### Extra goodies:
1 - Track your progress with helpful stats and beautiful sets of NFTs from artists all over the world.
2 - Set the difficulty rating: choose if the amounts of points you need for each NFT are easier (less points needed per NFT), medium (a few more needed for each) or hard (for those who like a challenge).
3 - New lightmode feature for your tasks area.

‚ú® Simplify Your Life: Unclutter your mind and workspace for enhanced productivity.
‚ú® Stay Focused: Say goodbye to decision fatigue and hello to laser-sharp focus.
‚ú® Achieve More: Leverage your hard work by earning each time you complete a task, tracking progress to completing your gallery along the way.

üå∫ TaskBloomer: Where Priorities Blossom üå∫


Dear Ambitious Achievers,

Whether you a professional seeking a better system to order their daily tasks, a freelancer juggling multiple projects feeling unrewarded by continuious to-dos, or perhaps an art enthusiast looking for their next online art collection, TaskBloomer is crafted with YOU in mind.

TaskBloomer is unique, not only because you earn points for every task you check off (which in itself is satisfying!), but your points automatically earn you assets each time you check off a task. You'll quickly find yourself noshing through those tasks for breakfast! 

The added benefit of including NFTs as part of your earning portfolio each time you hit a point threshold not only gives you the chance to look back at your NFTs and celebrate the work you have done to earn them, but also introduces you to new artists from across the globe!

## UX

TaskBloomer's design has been inspired by productivity sites such as Notion, featuring a deluxe yet visually simple aethetic to avoid overstimulation, with the main interactive areas clear and consise.

TaskBloomer is made up intentionally of two main pages (landing page with instructions, and the main task area) to make navigation feel clean and simple to use. All bonus features such as the stats area and gallery are included with user needs in mind. 
Principally the main ideas are prioritised:
- How to play 
- Setting consise task descriptions 
- Earning NFTs 
- Checking your stats

*Your feedback is crucial, so please share your thoughts to help us refine and enhance our user-centric approach. Let's make every click count! * üöÄ 


### Colour Scheme

The default color scheme is a dark theme, consisting of the follwing colors:  

- `#0e100f` used for background.
- `#fffce1` used for primary text.
- `#93B569` used for primary highlights.
- `#BDBDBD` used for secondary highlights.

If light mode is enabled on the task area by the user, the following custom variables are used: 

- `#fffce1` used for background.
- `#3D3D3D` used for primary text.
- `#93B569` used for primary highlights.
- `#2c2c2c` used for secondary highlights.


I used coolors.co to generate my colour palettes.

[coolors.co](https://coolors.co/0e100f-fffce1-93b569-bdbdbd)

![screenshot](documentation/dark-mode.png)
![screenshot](documentation/light-mode.png)

I also ensured that for the text and background colors for both dark and light mode were verified accessible through coolors' [coolors.co] (https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5) color contrast checker for maximum accessibility.


### Typography

- [EB Garamond](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/EB+Garamond) was used for all text elements, chosen for its readability and established use across platforms.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the icons for the hero cards on the landing page.

## Features

<!-- List different parts of your project.

Describe each in a sentence or so.

Explain value of each for the user:
 - who this website is for
 - what user want to achieve,
 - how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

IMPORTANT: Include a screenshot of each individual feature! -->


### Existing Features

- **Navbar**

    - The home navbar is a different color shade to the main background for improved visibility. It spans the entire width of page for a standard UI that users will likely expect. There is letter spacing styling consistent across whole navbar for improved UX. 
    The task page link includes an animation to show the user on mouse hover that the link is clickable. Task page link also has a border to immediately visually differentiate it from the app title on the left. 


![screenshot](documentation/screenshots/feature01.jpeg)

- **Hero Boxes**

    - Three justified boxes in the center of the home page are used to immediately capture the user's eye and succinctly inform the user some of the main features of the app. Using consistent icons and coloring, these boxes then come with further information if the user scrolls down where each catchword is explained in mored detail about the app's features.

![screenshot](documentation/screenshots/feature02.jpeg)

- **Instructions Accordion**

    - A collapsable accordion with three tabs (demarkated with both numbers and the respective amount of leaf icons colored the same as the emphasis text for continuity) on click expand on the home page to reveal step by step guidelines for how to use and make the most of the app. They first appear closed to ensure the page is not overwhelming for the user and improve page naviation. There are arrows at the right of each section to signal that they are openable to the user. 

![screenshot](documentation/screenshots/feature03.jpeg)





- **Difficulty Settings**

    - An apppropriately colored set of radio buttons show the user three difficulty settings: easy, medium and hard. As is explained in the instructions, these affect the amount of points until your next NFT. Only one can be clicked at a time, and the settings have colors associated with their corresponding level type for ease of use and discoverability.

![screenshot](documentation/screenshots/feature04.jpeg)


- **Light Mode**

    - Light mode toggles the task area theme between dark and light bootstrap themes with further added custom color variables added for improved visibility. This enables the user to optimise the task area of the app to suit their needs best for improved visibility.

![screenshot](documentation/screenshots/feature05.jpeg)

- **Custom Reset Time**

    - The custom reset time allows the user to change the default time that their goals are automatically cleared each day, not only to give users a deadline and motivation, but also to further customise their task area workspace and avoid unneccessary menial work. This is particularly useful for returning users wanting to customise their workspace better for how they use the app.

![screenshot](documentation/screenshots/feature06.jpeg)

- **Your Stats Area Toggle**

    - This area is toggled open and closed by the 'Your Stats' button near the top of the task area, to improve the UI and UX for the user by ensuring it does not take up more real estate than is needed. A returning user may find its information helpful but a first time user may find it overwhelming, hence it first loads as untoggled. 

![screenshot](documentation/screenshots/feature07.jpeg)

- **Table of Stats**

    - Within the table of stats, there are three main important pieces of information, particularly useful to returning users who are familiar with how the app works. First is the 'next growth point' which demonstrates the user's next total points goal in order to earn the next NFT. Underneath this, there is a counter in brackets which shows how many points the user needs to earn before they reach that next NFT goal. Their total points is displayed below this to continue to motivate the user and inform them of their current progress.

![screenshot](documentation/screenshots/feature07.jpeg)

- **Progress Bar**

    - The progress bar allows users to quickly see their progress to the next NFT in a visual way rather than a numerical way as with the table of stats. This will help motivate both new and returning users alike to continue completing their tasks on the way to earning the next NFT.

![screenshot](documentation/screenshots/feature08.jpeg)

- **Goals Character Count**

    - The character counter only appears after the first time a user starts putting goals into the input areas. It reminds the user to keep their goals consise and appears green with their character count until the user comes very close to the maximum character limit of 25 characters. If the user hits 25 characters, an alert will pop up stopping the user to type further and remind them to keep their goals under 25 characters.

![screenshot](documentation/screenshots/feature09.jpeg)

- **Completed Tasks**

    - green, strickthrough 

![screenshot](documentation/screenshots/featureX.jpeg)

- **Button Hover Styles**

    - For YOUR STATS and New Day to highlight functionality and clickability for user, as well as promote discoverability and accessibility for new users less familiar with the app.

![screenshot](documentation/screenshots/featureX.jpeg)

- **Input Autofocus**

    - Autofocus for new page for returning users to efficiently start adding their goals to the tasks area.

![screenshot](documentation/screenshots/featureX.jpeg)

- **Checkbox disabled**

    - Disabled until goal written, with different color

![screenshot](documentation/screenshots/featureX.jpeg)
