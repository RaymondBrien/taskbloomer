            <p>List three concise goals you want to achieve in your day. Make these achievable within your day</p>
            <br>
            <p>Remember, be specific and intentional: there’s a character limit for a reason.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Task <b>A</b> earns you the big money - 3 points! 
                    This should be your biggest task of the day, due first or most important.</li>
                <li>Task <b>B</b> earns you 2 points.</li>
                <li>Task <b>C</b> earns you 1 point.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>    
            <p>Can’t think of three? Put an intention instead!</p> 
            <p><em>How about: drink 6 glasses of water today // meditate for 10 minutes // make time for a walk.</em></p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="instructions-heading">Step 2 (fontawesome icon)</h3>
            <p>Each time you complete a goal, click the ‘done’ icon and you earn points. Earn enough points and your plant will grow.</p> 
            <div>
                <p>Your goals self-destruct at <span></span>each night. (insert fontawesome spy icon/emoji).</p>

            <p>Take a deep breath and focus on your tasks and watch your plant continue to grow!</p>
            <br>
            <p><em>Finished them all already? Go you! Celebrate, knowing you’ve done what you set out to do today. (boxed text to separate from rest of instructions)</em></p>

                <p>Never-ending to-do lists and time crunches are exhausting. Focus on your three tasks, one at a time. You deserve to celebrate the little successes on the way to your big wins.</p>
